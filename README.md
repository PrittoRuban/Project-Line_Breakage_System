<h1 align="center">Transmission line Breakage Detection and Alerting System</h1>
<p align="center">Many times we read in newspapers that Humans & Animals die due to electrical shock in remote areas or in agricultural areas as contact with broken & hanging live supply wires. Safety circuitry of Distribution Company is inadequate and due to this line remains live with broken wires. Here we describe a modification to existing power distribution system for wire break detection and a power supply breaking mechanism. Circuit breaker with shunt trip mechanism breaks the supply and avoids damages from electrical accidents due to overhead transmission lines conductor breakage problems. We utilize various communication devices to provide indication about the amount of voltages transmitted from one section to another.</p>
